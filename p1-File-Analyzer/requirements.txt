# File Analyzer Requirements
# This project uses only Python standard library modules
# No external dependencies required

# The following are standard library modules used:
# - os: Operating system interface
# - sys: System-specific parameters and functions  
# - pathlib: Object-oriented filesystem paths
# - argparse: Command-line argument parsing
# - json: JSON encoder and decoder
# - csv: CSV file reading and writing
# - collections: Specialized container datatypes
# - re: Regular expression operations
# - datetime: Date and time handling
# - mimetypes: MIME type detection

# If you want to enhance the analyzer with additional features, 
# you might consider these optional packages:
# pandas>=1.3.0        # For advanced CSV/data analysis
# python-magic>=0.4.24 # For better file type detection
# chardet>=4.0.0       # For character encoding detection
# pillow>=8.0.0        # For image file analysis
